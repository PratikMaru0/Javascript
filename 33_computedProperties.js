// Computed Properties 
const key1 = "objectkey1";
const key2 = "objectkey2";

const value1 = "myValue1";
const value2 = "myValue2";

const obj = {
    [key1] : value1,  // This bracket thing is known as computed properties. Just see the output answers. You'll get to know.
    [key2] : value2,  
};
// console.log(obj);

// Another way to do this 
// const obj1 = {}

// obj1[key1] = value1;
// obj1[key2] = value1;

// console.log(obj1);

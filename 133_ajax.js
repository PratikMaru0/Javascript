// Basic Theory.

// AJAX :- Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. 

// AJAX is a set of "web development techniques" using many web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web application. Means using HTTP request we can get,set data from the server-side (server (API) koi bhi language mai likha ho hume farak nhi padta. It can be in NodeJS, .Net, etc) but in client-side we use JavaScript mostly. And yeh data retrieval, updation, creation, deletion ka kaam asynchronously hota hai yeh browser karta hai kaam humae iski tension lene ki jarurat nhi hai. 

// With AJAX, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page.

// We dont use data in XML format anymore.
// we JSON now. (JavaScript Object Notation)

// We have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server 
// 1). xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
// 2). fetch API (new way of doing)
// 3). axios (this is the third party library)

// Harshit bhai usese fetchAPI and axios mostly in Projects. Becoz xmlHTTPRequest se code kafi bada hojata hai but it doesn't mean its bad method its fast method.

// We'll learn all this so that we can get to know how behind the scenes things are working.
// This is the Basic theory....âœ¨ We'll start doing practical from nextFile.

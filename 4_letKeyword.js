// let keyword 
// We know that we can declare variable with var keyword but we can also declare using let keyword.
// And difference between them we'll see this later on.

// NOTE: Always use let keyword while declaring the variables. 
// let fName = "Pratik Maru";
// console.log(fName);

// Now lets see difference between let and var 
// 1st scenario

// var fName = "Pratik";
// var fName = "Mohit";  // No error we can do this. 
// console.log(fName);

// let fName = "Pratik";
// let fName = "Radhim";  // Invalid it will give u an error. Its not allowed.
// console.log(fName);

// 2nd scenario 
// block scope vs function scope (we'll cover this in upcoming part.)
